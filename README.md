Product Funnel Analysis for SaaS FinTech
Executive Summary:
Order coversion has been low at our SaaS company, and we need to determine the root cause and potential solutions. Using SQL, Python, and
Power Bl, I pulled order status data from the database and created a dashboard to track orders through the funnel. After identifying that the
largest revenue opportunities are to increase user interaction rate and completed login attempts, I recommend that the product team
implements a few adjustments that will lead to higher conversion:

1. Copy changes within the workflow


2. Reminder emails/texts


3. Better client relationships
Business Problem:
Completed orders are essential for this Saas Fintech company since they're directly tied to revenue. Product and sales stakeholders have
noticed that the product has a lower conversion rate than expected (based on users who start orders vs. complete the order). How can we
determine where users are falling out of the workflow and make product adjustments to encourage users to complete their orders?

Methodology
Results & Business Recommendation:
Creating a dashboard to track product orders gives product and sales stakeholders visibility into the product funnel both overall and for
specific clients. Because of democratizing this data, stakeholders are now able to self serve, and the analytics team now has 5 less hours of ad for example
hoc requests per week This analysis showed us that almost 50% of orders fall out before entering the workflow, and less than 25% .example According to the model built in Power bi,  Metrics

Next Steps exampleMetrics with 1% Improvement Increase
Because the biggest revenue impacts will likely come from increasing the user interaction rate & completed login attempts, I recommend a few
product adjustments:

1. Send inactive users reminder emails and texts to encourage them to enter the platform to complete their order.


2. Work with clients (mortgage lenders) to help coach the users through the process and see the value in doing so.


3. Add copy at the beginning of the workflow stating that the process only takes 5 min, and feature a progress bar throughout to encourage
completion.


4. Add copy at the bank login page to encourage users to look up their credentials to make sure they're correct to reduce credential errors.
I believe these adjustments will best tackle the largest workflow fallout points, increase conversion & revenue, and save the analytics team
hours per week from a decrease in ad hoc requests.
Next Steps:


5. AB Test copy within the workflow
